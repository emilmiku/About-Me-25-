                <h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h2>
                <p><b>I used to be a pack rat. </b>I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I
                    couldn't even appreciate any of it because there
                    was too much.</p>
                <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't
                    hold
                    a
                    relationship.</p>
                <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
                <p><b>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</b>I literally put 90% of my
                    possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my
                    job.</p>
                <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to
                    do.
                    And it worked.
                </p>
                <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
                <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work
                    more, and I have
                    more free time to enjoy.</p>
                <p>With how much it turned my life around, <b>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did
                        it</b>,
                    and how others
                    can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
